# QML_tutorials
This repository consists of notebooks of Quantum Machine Learning, starting from the introduction to linear algebra, and some quantum basics to some advanced concepts in Quantum Machine Learning including some have-to-learn concepts of quantum mechanics and quantum computing.
I have taken some resources for making this possible. I started this work for QuantumAI as a part of the QML team.
